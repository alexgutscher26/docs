# Security

Security is a critical aspect of any web application. This guide covers essential security practices and configurations for your StackForge application.

## Overview

StackForge incorporates several security measures out of the box, but it's important to understand and implement additional security practices to ensure your application is properly protected. This section covers:

- **Next.js Best Practices**: Security considerations specific to Next.js applications
- **Data Validation**: Ensuring data integrity and preventing injection attacks
- **Content Security Policy**: Implementing CSP to prevent XSS attacks
- **Authentication Security**: Securing user authentication and sessions
- **Row Level Security**: Implementing fine-grained access control for your data
- **Database Security**: Protecting your data at the database level
