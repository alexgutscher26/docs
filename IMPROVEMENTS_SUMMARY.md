### 5. Development Guide (`development.mdx`)

- Updated prerequisites to match StackForge requirements (Node.js 18+, Bun, PostgreSQL, Clerk)
- Added information about StackForge development workflow
- Included troubleshooting for database connection issues

### 6. API Reference (`api-reference/introduction.mdx`)

- Completely rewritten to document StackForge API endpoints
- Added information about authentication with Clerk

## Key Improvements

1. **Technology Alignment**: All documentation now accurately reflects StackForge's technology stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL, Clerk, Bun)

2. **Setup Accuracy**: Quickstart guide now provides correct setup instructions for StackForge, including environment variables and database initialization

3. **API Documentation**: API reference now accurately documents StackForge's actual API endpoints and data models

4. **Development Workflow**: Development guide now provides accurate information about the StackForge development workflow

5. **AI Tool Integration**: AI tools documentation now provides context-specific guidance for developing with StackForge

6. **Project-Specific Information**: All documentation has been customized to reference StackForge-specific features, components, and workflows

## Benefits

These improvements will help developers:

- Quickly set up and run StackForge locally
- Understand the project structure and technology stack
- Effectively use AI tools for StackForge development
- Extend and customize the boilerplate for their specific needs
- Integrate with the API correctly
