# Authentication API

The Authentication API provides endpoints for user authentication using different authentication providers. StackForge supports multiple authentication providers including Clerk (default), Auth.js (NextAuth.js v5), and BetterStack (Better Auth).

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to your application's base URL. In development, this is typically `http://localhost:3000`.

## Authentication Providers

### Clerk (Default)

Clerk is the default authentication provider for StackForge. It provides a complete user management solution with pre-built UI components and robust security features.

The Clerk API routes are handled automatically by the Clerk SDK and do not require direct API calls in most cases.

### Auth.js (NextAuth.js v5)

Auth.js (formerly NextAuth.js) is an alternative authentication provider that can be used with StackForge.

#### Endpoints

- **URL**: `/api/auth/nextauth/[...nextauth]`
- **Methods**: `GET`, `POST`
- **Description**: Handles all Auth.js authentication flows

### BetterStack (Better Auth)

BetterStack is another alternative authentication provider that can be used with StackForge.

#### Endpoints

- **URL**: `/api/auth/betterauth/[...all]`
- **Methods**: `GET`, `POST`
- **Description**: Handles all BetterStack authentication flows

## Authentication Flow

The authentication flow varies depending on the provider being used:

1. **Clerk**: Uses Clerk's pre-built components and hooks
2. **Auth.js**: Uses Auth.js's pre-built components and hooks
3. **BetterStack**: Uses BetterStack's pre-built components and hooks

## Session Management

All authentication providers handle session management automatically. Session information is available through the respective provider's client SDKs.

## Error Handling

Authentication errors are handled by the respective authentication providers and typically result in redirects to appropriate error pages or login screens.
