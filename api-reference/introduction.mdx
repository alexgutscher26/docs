# API Reference

This section provides documentation for the API endpoints available in StackForge. The API is built using Next.js API routes and follows REST conventions.

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to your application's base URL. In development, this is typically `http://localhost:3000`.

## Authentication

Most API endpoints require authentication through Clerk. Authenticated requests should include a valid session token.

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. Exceeding the rate limit will result in a 429 status code.

## API Endpoints

The StackForge API is organized into several resource-based endpoints:

- [Posts API](/api-reference/posts) - Manage social media posts
- [Authentication API](/api-reference/authentication) - Handle user authentication
- [Error Report API](/api-reference/error-report) - Report application errors

## Data Models

### Post

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "userId": "string",
  "content": "string",
  "platform": "string",
  "status": "string",
  "scheduledAt": "datetime",
  "publishedAt": "datetime",
  "engagement": "number",
  "likes": "number",
  "shares": "number",
  "comments": "number",
  "createdAt": "datetime",
  "updatedAt": "datetime"
}
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests:

- `200`: Success
- `201`: Created
- `400`: Bad request
- `401`: Unauthorized
- `403`: Forbidden
- `404`: Not found
- `500`: Internal server error

Error responses include a JSON object with an error message:

```json
{
  "error": "Description of the error"
}
```
