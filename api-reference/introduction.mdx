## Welcome

StackForge provides a RESTful API for interacting with social media posts and user data. The API is built using Next.js API routes and follows standard REST conventions.

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the base URL of your StackForge deployment:

```
https://your-stackforge-domain.com/api
```

For local development, this would be:

```
http://localhost:3000/api
```

## Authentication

Most API endpoints require authentication through Clerk. Include the Clerk session token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CLERK_SESSION_TOKEN
```

## API Endpoints

The current API includes endpoints for managing social media posts:

- `GET /api/posts` - Retrieve all posts
- `POST /api/posts` - Create a new post
- `GET /api/posts/[id]` - Retrieve a specific post
- `PUT /api/posts/[id]` - Update a specific post
- `DELETE /api/posts/[id]` - Delete a specific post

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. Exceeding the rate limit will result in a 429 status code.

## Error Handling

API errors are returned in a consistent format:

```json
{
  "error": "Error message",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE"
}
```

## Response Format

Successful API responses follow this format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { /* Response data */ }
}
```
