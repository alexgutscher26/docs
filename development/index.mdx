# Development

This section covers everything you need to know about developing with StackForge, from setting up your local development environment to deploying your application.

## Overview

StackForge is built with modern development practices in mind, providing a robust foundation for building scalable web applications. This guide will walk you through the development process, from initial setup to deployment.

## Development Topics

- **Approaching Local Development**: Setting up your local environment and development workflow
- **Project Structure**: Understanding the StackForge project organization
- **Component Development**: Creating and customizing components
- **API Development**: Building and extending API endpoints
- **Database Management**: Working with the database schema and migrations
- **Testing**: Writing and running tests
- **Debugging**: Troubleshooting common development issues
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimizing your application for speed and efficiency
- **Access Control**: Implementing roles, permissions, and access control
- **Content Management**: Managing marketing pages and content
- **Search Engine Optimization**: Optimizing your application for search engines

## Prerequisites

Before you begin development with StackForge, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js version 18 or higher
- Bun package manager
- PostgreSQL database instance (local or cloud)
- Clerk account for authentication

If you don't have Bun installed, follow the [official installation guide](https://bun.sh/docs/installation).

## Getting Started

To get started with development:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using Bun
3. Set up environment variables
4. Initialize the database
5. Start the development server

For detailed instructions, see the [Quickstart Guide](/quickstart).

## Development Workflow

The typical development workflow with StackForge includes:

1. **Setup**: Configure your local environment
2. **Development**: Write code and test locally
3. **Testing**: Run tests to ensure quality
4. **Debugging**: Troubleshoot issues as they arise
5. **Optimization**: Improve performance and user experience
6. **Deployment**: Deploy your changes to production
