## Using the Playground

The playground allows you to:

1. **Browse Components**: Navigate through different categories to see all available components
2. **Interact with Components**: Many components are interactive, allowing you to test their functionality
3. **View Implementation**: See how components are implemented in code
4. **Copy Examples**: Use the examples as templates for your own components

## Adding New Components to the Playground

To add new components to the playground:

1. Open [src/app/(main)/dashboard/playground/page.tsx](<file:///C:/Users/madaj/OneDrive/Desktop/StackForge/src/app/(main)/dashboard/playground/page.tsx>)
2. Add a new category to the `categories` array if needed
3. Extend the `renderCategoryContent` function with examples for your new component
4. Import any required components at the top of the file

Example of adding a new category:

```tsx
// Add to categories array
const categories = [
  // ... existing categories
  { id: 'new-category', name: 'New Category', icon: NewIcon },
];

// Add case to renderCategoryContent function
case 'new-category':
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      <Card>
        <CardHeader>
          <CardTitle>New Component</CardTitle>
          <CardDescription>Description of the new component</CardDescription>
        </CardHeader>
        <CardContent>
          {/* Component examples */}
          <NewComponent />
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
```

## Best Practices

When using the Component Playground:

1. **Reference Examples**: Use the playground as a reference for implementing components in your features
2. **Test Interactions**: Interact with components to understand their behavior
3. **Check Responsiveness**: Test how components behave on different screen sizes
4. **Copy Implementation**: Use the implementation patterns as templates for your own components

## Customization

The Component Playground can be customized to match your application's needs:

1. **Add New Categories**: Extend the playground with additional component categories
2. **Modify Examples**: Update existing examples to match your use cases
3. **Add Custom Components**: Include your application-specific components
4. **Update Styling**: Modify the styling to match your brand
