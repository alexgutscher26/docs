  **Prerequisites**:
  - Node.js version 18 or higher
  - Bun package manager
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Clerk account for authentication
</Info>

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment for StackForge.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Bun">

StackForge uses Bun as its package manager and runtime. Install Bun by following the [official installation guide](https://bun.sh/docs/installation).

</Step>

<Step title="Preview documentation locally">

Navigate to your docs directory where your `docs.json` file is located, and run the following command:

```bash
mint dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Custom ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port Mintlify runs on by using the `--port` flag. For example, to run Mintlify on port 3333, use this command:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## StackForge Development Workflow

When developing for StackForge, you'll typically work with two separate processes:

1. **Next.js Development Server**: For the main application
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

2. **Documentation Server**: For the documentation site
   ```bash
   mint dev
   ```

## Validating links

The CLI can assist with validating links in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

## Deployment

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/checks-passed.png" alt="Screenshot of a deployment confirmation message that says All checks have passed." style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

## Code formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>

    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:
    1. Remove the currently-installed version of the CLI: `npm remove -g mint`
    2. Upgrade to Node v18 or higher.
    3. Reinstall the CLI: `npm i -g mint`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
  
    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the `~/.mintlify` folder. Then run `mint dev` again.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Issue: Database connection errors">
  
    Ensure your PostgreSQL database is running and the DATABASE_URL in your `.env.local` file is correct. You may need to run:
    
    ```bash
    bun run db:push
    ```
    
    to initialize your database schema.
