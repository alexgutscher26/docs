### How do I get access to the full repository?

To access the complete StackForge repository with all features and regular updates, you need to purchase a license. The public repository contains only a limited version for demonstration purposes.

## Technical Questions

### What are the system requirements?

To run StackForge, you need:
- Node.js 18.x or later
- Bun package manager (recommended)
- PostgreSQL database instance (local or cloud)
- Clerk account for authentication keys

### How do I set up the development environment?

1. Clone the repository (licensed users only)
2. Install dependencies using `bun install`
3. Set up environment variables in `.env.local`
4. Run database migrations with `bun run db:migrate`
5. Start the development server with `bun run dev`

### Can I use StackForge with other databases?

StackForge is configured to work with PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM. While it may be possible to adapt it for other databases, this would require significant modifications to the database layer.

### How do I deploy StackForge?

StackForge is optimized for deployment on Vercel:
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Set up the required environment variables in Vercel
4. Deploy your application

Alternative deployment platforms may require additional configuration.

### How do I update StackForge?

Licensed users receive regular updates. Follow our [Updating the Codebase](/updating-codebase) guide for detailed instructions on keeping your project up to date.

## Development Questions

### How do I create new pages?

To create new pages in StackForge:
1. Create a new directory in `src/app/` following the route group structure
2. Add a `page.tsx` file with your page content
3. Use TypeScript for type safety
4. Style with Tailwind CSS utility classes

### How do I add new components?

To add new components:
1. Create a new file in the appropriate directory under `src/components/`
2. Follow the Container-Component pattern
3. Use TypeScript interfaces for props
4. Export components in the corresponding `index.ts` file

### How do I work with the database?

StackForge uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL:
- Define schemas in `src/db/schema/`
- Use `db.query.tableName.findFirst()` for lookups
- Use `db.insert(tableName).values()` for creation
- Always implement proper error handling

### How do I handle authentication?

StackForge uses Clerk for authentication:
- Protected routes are handled via middleware
- Authentication state is managed through Clerk's React context
- Use Clerk's components and hooks for sign-in/sign-up flows

## Troubleshooting

### I'm getting TypeScript errors. What should I do?

Common TypeScript issues and solutions:
1. Ensure all type imports use the `type` modifier when `verbatimModuleSyntax` is enabled
2. Check that environment variables are accessed using bracket notation: `process.env["VAR_NAME"]`
3. Verify that all functions have explicit return types
4. Run `bun run lint` to check for code quality issues

### My database connection isn't working. How can I fix it?

1. Verify your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local` is correct
2. Ensure your PostgreSQL instance is running
3. Check that your database credentials are valid
4. Run `bun run db:studio` to verify the connection

### The development server won't start. What should I check?

1. Ensure all required environment variables are set
2. Check that Bun is properly installed
3. Verify that all dependencies are installed with `bun install`
4. Check the terminal output for specific error messages
