# Data Fetching

Data fetching is a critical aspect of any web application. This section covers patterns, best practices, and security considerations for fetching data in your StackForge application.

## Overview

StackForge provides several approaches for data fetching, each with its own use cases and benefits. This guide covers the different methods available and when to use them.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Server Components** for data that doesn't change frequently
2. **Implement proper error handling** for all data fetching operations
3. **Cache appropriately** to improve performance
4. **Validate all input data** to prevent injection attacks
5. **Use streaming** for large datasets
6. **Implement proper loading states** for better UX

## Security Considerations

- Always implement CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Validate and sanitize all input data
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

## Performance Optimization

- Use React's built-in caching mechanisms
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Use selective data fetching to minimize payload size
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use Suspense for loading states
