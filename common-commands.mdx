# Common Commands

This guide provides a quick reference for the most commonly used commands when developing with StackForge. These commands cover development, building, database management, code quality, and other essential tasks that are actually configured in the project.

## Development Commands

### Start Development Server

Start the development server with hot reloading:

```bash
bun run dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Build for Production

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
bun run build
```

### Start Production Server

Start the production server after building:

```bash
bun run start
```

## Database Commands

StackForge uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL. Here are the essential database commands:

### Push Schema Changes (Development Only)

Push schema changes directly to the database (development only):

```bash
bun run db:push
```

### Generate Migrations

Generate migration files from schema changes:

```bash
bun run db:generate
```

### Apply Migrations

Apply generated migrations to the database:

```bash
bun run db:migrate
```

### Open Drizzle Studio

Open Drizzle Studio for database management and visualization:

```bash
bun run db:studio
```

### Seed Database

Seed the database with sample data:

```bash
bun run db:seed
```

## Code Quality Commands

### Lint Code

Run ESLint to check for code quality issues:

```bash
bun run lint
```

### Format Code

Format code with Prettier:

```bash
bun run format
```

### Check Code Formatting

Check if code is properly formatted without making changes:

```bash
bun run format:check
```

## Package Management Commands

### Install Dependencies

Install all dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

### Add New Dependency

Add a new dependency:

```bash
bun add [package-name]
```

### Add Development Dependency

Add a new development dependency:

```bash
bun add -d [package-name]
```

### Remove Dependency

Remove a dependency:

```bash
bun remove [package-name]
```

## Component Development Commands

### Generate New Components

Create new components using the shadcn/ui CLI (if installed):

```bash
bunx shadcn-ui@latest add [component-name]
```

## Advanced Development Commands

### Enable Turbopack

Run development server with Turbopack for faster builds:

```bash
bun run dev --turbo
```

### Build with Turbopack

Build for production with Turbopack:

```bash
bun run build --turbo
```

## Notes

- All commands should be run from the root directory of your StackForge project
- Make sure you have Bun installed and properly configured
- Always check the terminal output for any errors or warnings
- For production deployments, ensure all environment variables are properly set
