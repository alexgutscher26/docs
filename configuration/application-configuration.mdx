# Application Configuration

StackForge requires several environment variables to be configured for proper operation. This guide will walk you through setting up your application configuration and validating it before starting the server.

## Required Environment Variables

Before starting your StackForge application, you must configure the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file:

```env
# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=StackForge
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3000

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/stackforge

# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/auth/signin
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/auth/signup
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_URL=/
```

## Environment Variable Validation

StackForge includes built-in Zod validation to ensure all required environment variables are properly configured. The validation runs automatically when you start the server, but you can also run it manually:

```bash
bun run env:validate
```

If any environment variables are missing or invalid, you'll receive a clear error message indicating what needs to be fixed.

## Configuration Steps

### 1. Create Environment File

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of your project:

```bash
touch .env.local
```

### 2. Configure Variables

Add the required environment variables to your `.env.local` file. Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration:

- **App Configuration**: Set your application name and domain
- **Database**: Configure your PostgreSQL connection string
- **Clerk Authentication**: Add your Clerk API keys and URLs

### 3. Validate Configuration

Validate your environment variables to ensure they are correctly configured:

```bash
bun run env:validate
```

### 4. Start the Server

Once your environment variables are configured and validated, you can start the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

The server will automatically validate your environment variables on startup. If any variables are missing or invalid, the server will not start and will provide an error message.

## Optional Environment Variables

You can also configure these optional environment variables to enhance your application:

```env
# Email Service Configuration (optional)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key

# Analytics and Monitoring (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ANALYTICS_ID=your_vercel_analytics_id

# Feature Flags (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DARK_MODE=true
```

## Security Best Practices

When working with environment variables, follow these security best practices:

1. **Never commit secrets to version control**: Always add `.env*` files to your `.gitignore`
2. **Use different keys for different environments**: Never use production keys in development
3. **Rotate keys regularly**: Update your API keys and secrets periodically
4. **Limit permissions**: Ensure API keys have the minimum required permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Environment Variables**: Ensure all required variables are set in your environment
2. **Invalid Database URL**: Verify your `DATABASE_URL` format and credentials
3. **Clerk Authentication Errors**: Check your Clerk keys and domain settings

### Debugging Environment Variables

To debug environment variables in development:

1. Check that your `.env.local` file exists and is properly formatted
2. Verify that variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters around the `=` sign
4. Restart your development server after making changes
