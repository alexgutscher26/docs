# Troubleshooting Installation Issues

This guide helps you resolve common issues that may occur during the installation and setup of StackForge.

## Cannot Clone the Repository

Issues related to cloning the repository are usually related to a Git misconfiguration in your local machine. The commands displayed in this guide using SSH will only work if you have set up your SSH keys with GitHub.

If you run into issues, please make sure you follow GitHub's guide to set up your SSH key.

If this also fails, please use HTTPS instead. You will be able to see the commands in the repository's GitHub page under the "Clone" dropdown.

Please also make sure that the account that has access to StackForge and the locally connected account are the same.

## The Next.js Dev Server Does Not Start

This may happen due to some issues with the packages. Try to clean the workspace and reinstall everything again:

```bash
# Remove node_modules and bun.lock
rm -rf node_modules
rm bun.lock

# Clear Bun cache
bun pm cache rm

# Reinstall dependencies
bun install
```

You can now retry running the dev server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

## Database Connection Issues

If you cannot connect to your PostgreSQL database, check the following:

### Verify Database URL Format

Ensure your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local` follows the correct format:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name
```

### Check PostgreSQL Service

Make sure PostgreSQL is running on your local machine:

```bash
# On macOS with Homebrew
brew services list | grep postgresql

# On Linux
sudo systemctl status postgresql

# On Windows
# Check if PostgreSQL service is running in Services
```

### Test Database Connection

Test your database connection with the following command:

```bash
# Test connection using psql
psql "postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name"
```

## Bun Installation Issues

If you're having trouble with Bun installation:

### Install Bun

Follow the official Bun installation guide:

```bash
# Install Bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### Verify Bun Installation

Check that Bun is properly installed:

```bash
bun --version
```

If Bun is not recognized, you may need to add it to your PATH or restart your terminal.

## Environment Variable Issues

### Missing Environment Variables

Ensure all required environment variables are set in your `.env.local` file:

```env
# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=StackForge
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DOMAIN=localhost:3000

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name

# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/auth/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/auth/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_URL=/dashboard
```

### Validate Environment Variables

Run the environment validation script to check for issues:

```bash
bun run env:validate
```

## Drizzle ORM Issues

### Generate Drizzle Client

If you encounter issues with Drizzle ORM, try regenerating the client:

```bash
bun run drizzle-kit generate
```

### Run Migrations

Ensure your database schema is up to date:

```bash
bun run db:migrate
```

## Clerk Authentication Issues

### Invalid Clerk Keys

Verify that your Clerk API keys are correct:

1. Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`
2. Check that `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`
3. Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters in the keys

### Clerk Redirect Issues

If you're experiencing redirect issues:

1. Verify that `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL` match your actual auth routes
2. Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_URL` point to valid pages

## Port Conflicts

If you get an error that port 3000 is already in use:

```bash
# Kill processes using port 3000
npx kill-port 3000

# Or start the development server on a different port
bun run dev --port 3001
```

## Dependency Issues

### Outdated Dependencies

Update dependencies to their latest versions:

```bash
bun update
```

### Resolving Dependency Conflicts

If you encounter dependency conflicts:

```bash
# Remove node_modules and lock file
rm -rf node_modules
rm bun.lock

# Clear cache and reinstall
bun pm cache rm
bun install
```

## TypeScript Issues

### Type Errors

If you're seeing TypeScript errors:

```bash
# Check for type errors
bun run type-check

# Clean and rebuild
bun run clean
bun run build
```

### Verbatim Module Syntax

Ensure that all type imports use the `type` modifier when `verbatimModuleSyntax` is enabled:

```ts
// ❌ Incorrect
import { UserType } from '@/types/user';

// ✅ Correct
import { type UserType } from '@/types/user';
```

## Build Issues

### Production Build Failures

If your production build fails:

```bash
# Clean build cache
bun run clean

# Run build with verbose output
bun run build --verbose
```

### Memory Issues During Build

If you encounter memory issues during build:

```bash
# Increase Node.js memory limit
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" bun run build
```

## Common Error Messages

### "Module not found" Errors

If you see module not found errors:

1. Check that all dependencies are installed with `bun install`
2. Verify import paths are correct
3. Ensure file names and extensions are correct

### "Cannot find module" Errors

For module resolution issues:

```bash
# Clear module resolution cache
bun pm cache rm
bun install
```

## Platform-Specific Issues

### Windows Issues

On Windows, you might encounter path-related issues. Use PowerShell or Git Bash instead of Command Prompt for better compatibility.

### macOS Issues

On macOS, ensure you're using the latest version of Bun and that it's properly installed:

```bash
# Update Bun
bun upgrade

# Check installation
bun --version
```

### Linux Issues

On Linux, you might need to install additional dependencies:

```bash
# Install build essentials
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```
