## Get started in three steps

Set up your local development environment and start building your AI-powered social media marketing platform.

### Step 1: Set up your local environment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="copy" title="Clone the repository">
    First, clone the StackForge repository to your local machine:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shreyas-29/StackForge-ai.git
    cd StackForge-ai
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Install dependencies">
    StackForge uses Bun as its package manager. Install all dependencies with:
    
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="database" title="Set up environment variables">
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and configure the required environment variables:
    
    ```env
    # App Configuration
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=StackForge
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3000

    # Database
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/stackforge

    # Clerk Authentication
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/auth/signin
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/auth/signup
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_URL=/
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_URL=/
    ```
    
    You'll need to create accounts with [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/) and set up a PostgreSQL database to get the required keys and connection string.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Initialize the database

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="database" title="Run database migrations">
    StackForge uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL. Push the schema to your database:
    
    ```bash
    bun run db:push
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="seedling" title="(Optional) Seed the database">
    Populate your database with sample data for testing:
    
    ```bash
    bun run db:seed
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Start the development server

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Run the development server">
    Start the Next.js development server:
    
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```
    
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see your StackForge application running!
    
    <Tip>Your development server will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="globe" title="Explore the application">
    Once the server is running, you can:
    
    - Visit the marketing pages at the root URL
    - Navigate to `/dashboard` to see the authenticated dashboard
    - Try the authentication flows at `/auth/signin` and `/auth/signup`
    - Explore the API endpoints at `/api/posts`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
